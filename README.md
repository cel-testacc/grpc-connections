# grpc-connections
This will be a repository containing test implementations of grpc/protobufs in various languages

## Initial scaffolding:
1. create grpc client/server using go
2. create grpc client/server in python (django this time, since i already have a flask implementation)
3. create grpc client/server using ruby
